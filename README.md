##### Portraits Data

For each player, there will be several values to describe his/her status in the game every day which are automatically generated by game server, and that is the portraits data. We will always combine one player's portrait data in a week for convenience.
There're three files in this Portraits_data folder, data in the same file is sampled from a certain week, and different files are corresponding to different weeks, the folder structure is:
+ Portraits_data
    * train.json
    * valid.json
    * test.json

In each file, portrait data is saved in the format as below:
```python
{
    "role_id_foo":[
        [...],  # portrait data of role_id_foo on first day
        [...],  # portrait data of role_id_foo on second day
        [...],  # portrait data of role_id_foo on third day
        [...],  # portrait data of role_id_foo on fourth day
        [...],  # portrait data of role_id_foo on fifth day
        [...],  # portrait data of role_id_foo on sixth day
        [...],  # portrait data of role_id_foo on seventh day
    ]ï¼Œ
    ...  # some other role_id
}
```

##### Behavior Sequence Data

Players' behavior sequence will always be recorded by the game server, but only some events defined by game provider will be considered as behaviors that players can take. We rank the events by two levels, each event will have a level-1 event id and a level-2 event id, we will also record the grade when the player take any action, specially 000 in grade field means record missing, the truth grade can be refered by grade field in the context. We save different players' data separately, role_id_foo.json file contains the behavior sequence data of role_id_foo, the folder structure is: 
+ Behavior_sequence_data
    * train
        * role_id_foo.json
        * role_id_bar.json
        * ...
    * valid
        * role_id_foo.json
        * role_id_bar.json
        * ...
    * test
        * role_id_foo.json
        * role_id_bar.json
        * ...

In each file, behavior sequence data is saved in the format as below:
```python
[
    "2018-11-15 01:07:48#000#400063#21080002",  # "timestamp#current grade#event id level1#event id level2"
    "2018-11-15 01:07:48#000#400063#21080004",  # "timestamp#current grade#event id level1#event id level2"
    ...
]
```
